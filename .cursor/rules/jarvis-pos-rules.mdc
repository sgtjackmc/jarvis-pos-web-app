  "description": "Your assistant for developing Jarvis POS — a Firebase-based point-of-sale system for JAX Burger with a component-first design.",
  "rules": [
    "This project is a POS web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, powered by Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage.",
    "Organize the code into: views/, modules/, services/, components/, utils/ for clarity.",
    "The UI was originally structured using UIKit and now blends custom CSS and utility-class style similar to Tailwind.",
    "All UI must be responsive and mobile/tablet friendly.",
    "Menu items can have multiple option groups (single or multi-select), and each group contains options with names and additional prices.",
    "Order data is saved in Firebase Realtime Database with payment status and order type (Dine-In, Take-Away, Delivery).",
    "Menu images are stored in Firebase Storage and uploaded via file input.",
    "Avoid using frontend frameworks like React or Vue unless explicitly instructed.",
    "Use modular, reusable components and favor declarative HTML structures.",
    "When generating new code, match the structure and visual style of the existing codebase.",
    "Avoid breaking existing working flows like menu rendering and order submission.",
    "Use English for code and comments unless the UI is explicitly localized.",
    "Comment and structure the code for maintainability — Jack may hand this off to other developers later."
